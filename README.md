# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis in Software Development** repository.

This repository serves as a resource for understanding and documenting the critical first phase of the software development life cycle — Requirement Analysis. It includes information, examples, and practical guidance on how to gather, evaluate, and document software requirements to ensure successful project execution.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that lays the foundation for successful project execution.

During this phase, software engineers and business analysts work closely with clients, users, and other stakeholders to understand what the system must do, how it should perform, and any constraints that must be considered. This process involves interviews, questionnaires, observations, and document analysis to collect both functional and non-functional requirements.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding:** Ensures that both developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s goals.
- **Reduced Development Costs:** Helps avoid costly changes and rework by identifying requirements early in the process.
- **Better Planning:** Provides a solid base for project planning, time estimation, and resource allocation.
- **Improved Quality:** Leads to the development of software that meets user expectations and business needs.
- **Risk Management:** Identifies potential challenges and ambiguities before development begins.

A well-executed requirement analysis phase increases the likelihood of delivering a successful and high-quality software product.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in software development. Its importance lies in ensuring that the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations. Below are three key reasons why this phase is critical:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
Clear and well-documented requirements minimize the chances of misunderstanding between stakeholders and developers. It also helps define the scope of the project, reducing the risk of unplanned features (scope creep) that could derail the timeline and budget.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost
By identifying and resolving ambiguities early in the SDLC, requirement analysis helps avoid rework during development. This proactive approach significantly reduces the cost of fixing issues later in the project.

### 3. Enhances Product Quality
When requirements are accurate and complete, developers can build a system that meets real user needs. This results in a more reliable, user-friendly, and effective product that performs as expected under real-world conditions.

Understanding the "why" behind each requirement also enables better testing, validation, and alignment with business objectives.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several essential activities that ensure the project is built on a clear and agreed-upon foundation. Below are the five key activities typically performed:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This involves collecting information from stakeholders, users, and other sources to understand what the system should achieve. It sets the stage for all other activities.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Techniques such as interviews, surveys, brainstorming, and observation are used to extract detailed requirements from stakeholders. This helps uncover both explicit and hidden needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Once collected, the requirements are documented clearly and systematically. This documentation serves as a reference for both development and validation and may include use cases, user stories, or functional specifications.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Requirements are analyzed to resolve conflicts, check feasibility, and prioritize them. Modeling techniques such as data flow diagrams or use case diagrams may be used to visualize system behavior and interactions.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  The documented requirements are reviewed and validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect the intended needs. This step ensures the requirements are complete, consistent, and aligned with business goals.
  ## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into two main types: Functional and Non-functional. Understanding the difference between these two is crucial for building a reliable and user-friendly system.

### Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements describe the specific behavior or functions of the system — what the system should do.

**Examples for a Booking Management Project:**
- Users can create, view, update, and cancel bookings.
- The system must send confirmation emails after successful bookings.
- Admins can manage availability and view booking reports.
- Users can search for available dates and filter by location or service type.

These requirements define the *core features* and *interactions* the system must support.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional Requirements define the system’s operational qualities — how the system performs its functions.

**Examples for a Booking Management Project:**
- The system should load any page within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.
- Booking data must be encrypted in transit and at rest to ensure security.
- The application should be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).
- The interface must be responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

These requirements focus on *performance, reliability, usability,* and *security*.
